# Financial Record API

This repository concerns the **development of an API to register and obtain information related to financial operations made by users**. The goal of this project is to try out different technologies and be able to build an API from scratch. I hope in the future it can become useful to keep track of my spendings, organize them in categories and learn something from it. 

This API will be developed using Java and Spring. It is expected to use a database in SQL, probably PostgreSQL, to store the information related to the users, financial operations, categories of financial operations, etc.

Examples of **API requests** meant to be available in the future:

- Register user
- Register category of financial operation
- Register financial operation of an user
- Get financial operations from a user within a period of time
- Get total spendings of an user within a period of time
- Get spendings of an user within a period of time, organized in categories

Authentication is a mandatory part of this project, in order to avoid unwanted access to financial operations from other users. Nevertheless, since this is an educational project, it'll probably only be developed in the future.
